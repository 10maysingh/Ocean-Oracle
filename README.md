# Ocean-Oracle


üåü **Overview**
---------------

This website leverages Machine Learning (ML) to predict whether a whale is present at a given location and time based on the following input parameters:

-   **Latitude**
-   **Longitude**
-   **Date (Day, Month, Year)**

It provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can input these parameters, and the model will output a prediction of whether a whale is likely to be present.

üéØ **Purpose of the Website**
-----------------------------

The website aims to assist researchers, conservationists, and marine enthusiasts in identifying potential whale presence in specific geographical locations and times. By using historical and environmental data, it predicts the probability of whale occurrence, which can be useful in:

-   **Marine Conservation:** Planning safe shipping routes to avoid harming marine life.
-   **Research:** Assisting marine biologists in studying whale migration patterns and behaviors.
-   **Ecotourism:** Guiding operators to organize whale-watching tours more efficiently.
-   **Environmental Impact Analysis:** Understanding whale habitats to mitigate environmental damage.

üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**
--------------------

1.  **User Input:**\
    Enter latitude, longitude, and a specific date (day, month, year) into the form.

2.  **ML Model Prediction:**

    -   The backend processes the input data using a trained ML model.
    -   The model uses pre-processed historical whale sightings, oceanographic data, and time-series analysis to determine the likelihood of whale presence.
3.  **Result Display:**\
    The website outputs either:

    -   **Whale Present**
    -   **Whale Not Present**\
        (Along with confidence scores for the prediction.)

üì¶ **Technical Details**
------------------------

-   **Frontend:** Built with modern web technologies (e.g., React, HTML/CSS).
-   **Backend:** Powered by Python/Flask for API handling.
-   **ML Model:** A supervised learning model trained on a dataset of historical whale sightings and environmental features.
-   **Database:** Includes a curated dataset of latitude, longitude, and temporal whale observation data.
